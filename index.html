                    As a Game Programmer, my main interest is to create and develop smooth and satisfying Gameplay features for any
                    game I work on. I also enjoy to plan, optimize and bring useful Gameplay Systems to life,
                    making the workflow easier either for designers so they can focus on ideating and testing functionalities, or 
                    other programmers so that retouching, mantaining or updating the code is no big deal.

                    As a hobby, I also enjoy voice acting. Even though I'm Italian, you can expect to find some of my voice in games

                                A big classic. This was my first ever project from every point of view. First team work with designers, first academic project, first Unity approach.
                                Looking at it makes me feel nostalgic! The game is a revisitation of the classic Snake. In SnakeShifter you will start as a white snake,
                                and after eating your first "fruit", you will only be able to eat subsequent "fruits" that share the same shape with the one you just ate, or
                                the same color (ever played Uno?). Add this to some ticking time bombs (the pulsating "fruits"), the increasing speed, and the power-ups, and you obtain
                                a pretty entertaining game for a first timer!
                                <br>
                                The game looks 2D but it's actually just using an ortographic camera looking at the game field. 
                                <br>
                                The game only uses Unity's basic shapes, and it operates on a system of custom ticks that happen in calculated moments. The code is what it is,
                                I also smile when looking back at this project, but I can't say I didn't have fun!

                                Of all the projects I did, SusPack is like the dear child I always keep in my heart. 
                                It was my very first experience working on a game jam (aka very unhealthy lifestyle consisting on sleepless nights and a nutricious intake not definable as "diet") and my very first work done outside of my academic career. 
                                <br>
                                The theme of the jam was "Bubble".
                                <br>
                                It may seem like nothing, but projects done as a student are always "safer", meaning you have experienced people covering your back and offering help, especially during the project's organization phases. 
                                Here, we were completely independent, and I also worked with people I never met before (they were the minority, but still) and let me tell you... It absolutely shows.
                                The repository of this project is a complete mess, and I still remember during the last day, all the colliders in the level magically disappeared, which meant rushing in the final minutes to put everything back (we failed).
                                If this is not the core experience of a game jam, I don't know what is.
                                <br>
                                In SusPack you play as a man that sent some... "suspicious packages" to an acquaintance of his while being in an inebriated state.
                                The morning after, he regrets his choice and goes to infiltrate the post warehouse to "steal back" the packages before they are actually sent  for good.
                                If only the office wasn't guarded by patrolling robots ready to not let anyone interfere with their jobs...

                                P.S. Even if we didn't personally record a trailer for this game, and the gameplay footage is kinda random, there was one person that decided to speedrun our game 10 minutes after we released it. I still don't know how he was able to complete it so fast after so less time, but I can for sure say me and my team were flattered to see our game being spedrun! To see that glorious performance, watch <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1fKjwZlBnMqGhCJPplJoQY-YAUvzbYL/view?usp=drive_link">this video</a>. Just please don't judge the game from what you see here, since it looks like a showcase of everything that is broken (walking during the black screen after the game is restarted, going through things which we didn't manage to put the collider back for in time)... Nonetheless, fun!

                                This was my second project and first ever mobile experiment!
                                The task was to create a game that would be playable in local coop on a single mobile screen.
                                My first thought was to push towards cooperation instead of competition, and I was able to convince the rest of the team to go for this path.
                                The idea was to have a little vehicle that could go in different directions depending on where the players would touch.
                                After a bit of brainstorming we thought about a little story about two vikings and a boat, that ended up being a whole situation in which instead of being two vikings on a boat, one of the vikings IS the boat, and the other one rides him.
                                Like that, Ragnaraft was born! Ride through the obstacles and get to the end to reach the damsel!
                                <br>
                                P.S. After a short time since the end of this project, the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3570070/Paddle_Paddle_Paddle/">Paddle Paddle Paddle</a> came out. I'm gonna be honest, I was a bit salty to see that an idea so similar to ours became viral after coming out, but at the same time, I was happy to see that Paddle Paddle Paddle is proof that the concept behind our game works!

                                ToDuat! is probably the first game I consider more on the "complete" side. It has a flow, it has a personality, and (something not to be taken for granted) you can reach an end!
                                <br>
                                The task assigned was to create a first person "job simulator" with a twist. We extracted the job from a jar of little papers, ending up with "funeral services".
                                We decided to set the game in an Egyptian atmosphere, with the "twist" of being Anubis' assistant.
                                <br>
                                The flow of the game is: a body arrives and you have to help Anubis to make his judgement: is this body worth to be sent to Duat, or is he a sinner and must be sent to rot in "hell"?
                                Following a set of instructions that Anubis left for you, you will be able to purify the body and prepare it for his voyage, and then send him to the correct destination.
                                The game is set in 4 different days, divided in two "work shifts". Every time you progress, new machinery, instructions and difficulties will add up to the cauldron of activities you need to do.
                                <br>
                                Depending on how good you perform, you can reach different endings. Will Anubis be satisfied with your work or will he consider sending you to rot in "hell"?

                                I consider the potential for this game to be... more than the average game made in 2 months. I recognize there is a little lack of feedbacks, and the way the player is instructed in what to do
                                is just not clear enough, creating a sense of confusion in the beginning.
                                <br><br>
                                During development, I tried my best to not use the default unity CharacterController, and doing my movement from scratch, without a Rigidbody.
                                <br>
                                Unfortunately, no matter how hard I tried, the movement is just not enough fine tuned. By spamming some buttons (just try, eventually you will succeed) you will be able to pass through things.
                                Grrrr... Maddening!
                                <br>
                                There is also a flow-breaking bug at the beginning of the game if you just... Do your best to not follow what the tutorial tells you to do. Will I correct it one day? Maybe...
                                <br><br>
                                P.S. A teammate of mine continued to work on this project for a while, implementing a more solid movement with the CharacterController. If you wish to try that build, contact me and I will find a way to
                                let you have it!

                                This is a cute one. This game is child of the last academy Game Jam we did in 2025 with Unity, before the end of the first year. The theme of the jam was "Duality",
                                so we decided to make a game about a robot underground ticket checker, that becomes a thief when in the shadows. The goal of the game is to check as many tickets as possible
                                and fine creatures without a ticket (if in the light), OR steal money and wallets from as many creatures as possible (while in the shadow).
                                <br>
                                As a Jam diversifier we chose to make a game without any text in it, so I hope the cute drawings will be enough to explain the rules!
                                <br>
                                This Jam was the first game in which i tried to experiment a little more with shaders. I will say that I successfully did what I set for myself as a goal (not without help),
                                and I learned to appreciate that magic feeling you experience when you see your shader working as intended. At the same time... boy if it's hard to make decent shaders.
                                <br>
                                Fortunately, whatever is hard to learn about game developing is also intrinsecally interesting for me. This is just to say that it's definitely not over between me and you, shaders.
